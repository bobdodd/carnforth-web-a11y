# Carnforth Web A11y - Session State for Continuation

## Current Date: January 25, 2025

## Work Completed in Previous Session:

### 1. Fixed `removeAllHighlights` Error
- Added typeof checks before calling the function to prevent errors when events fire early

### 2. Implemented Executive Summary for HTML Export
- Added executive summary section with infographics
- Fixed multiple UX issues with the summary implementation
- Implemented proper two-pass pie chart rendering with white background rectangles
- Used relative font sizes (rem) for accessibility
- Charts now match panel implementation exactly

### 3. Implemented Accessibility Metrics
- **Critical Barriers**: Count of show-stopping issues using specific patterns
- **Breadth Score**: (Touchpoints with failures / Total testable touchpoints) × 100
- **A11y Index**: Combined metric (0-100, higher is better)
- Added "Accessibility Metrics Explained" chapter to HTML export
- Fixed to show ALL critical barriers in report (no truncation)

### 4. Added Impact Level Filtering
- Added impact filter group (High, Medium, Low) as checkboxes
- Impact filters only apply to fail/warning issues (info has no impact)
- Added impact level preferences in preferences modal
- Filter state properly saved/loaded

### 5. Added Impact Level Grouping
- Added "Impact" as a grouping option (alongside None, Region, Guideline, Criteria)
- Groups display in order: High Impact, Medium Impact, Low Impact, Informational
- Fixed missing function definition error

## Work Completed in Current Session:

### 6. Enhanced Canvas-Based Map Detection
- Added sophisticated canvas map detection with WebGL context analysis
- Implemented tile pattern recognition and pixel variation detection
- Added touch interaction detection via CSS properties and transform states
- Created three new canvas-specific accessibility violations:
  - `canvas-map-missing-accessibility`: Canvas lacks role and aria-label
  - `canvas-map-not-keyboard-accessible`: Interactive canvas missing tabindex
  - `canvas-map-no-text-alternative`: No text description for map data
- Enhanced provider identification for canvas maps (Mapbox GL, Cesium, Deck.gl, etc.)
- Added comprehensive test fixtures for all canvas map scenarios

### 7. Enhanced WebGL Map Detection
- Implemented `analyzeWebGLMapPatterns()` function with sophisticated WebGL analysis
- Detects map-specific WebGL extensions (texture units, instanced arrays, etc.)
- Analyzes shader patterns for map-specific uniforms (u_matrix, u_zoom, etc.)
- Identifies 3D terrain maps vs 2D tile maps
- Added confidence scoring for detection accuracy
- Created new violation: `webgl-map-no-3d-instructions` for 3D maps lacking navigation help
- Enhanced provider detection using WebGL analysis results
- Added 6 new WebGL-specific test cases to fixtures

## Current TODO List (As of January 25, 2025):

### Completed:
- ✓ Canvas-based map detection (ID: 3)
- ✓ WebGL map detection (ID: 4)

### High Priority:
1. **Color Contrast Touchpoint** (ID: 1) - Detect insufficient contrast ratios
2. **Heading Order Touchpoint** (ID: 2) - Check heading hierarchy
3. **More sophisticated touch target analysis for map controls** (ID: 5)
   - 5.1: Custom Control Detection - Canvas-based controls, SVG controls, overlay controls, floating action buttons
   - 5.2: Control Clustering Analysis - Detect controls too close together, check spacing, identify overlapping areas
   - 5.3: Gesture-Based Control Patterns - Swipe areas, pinch-to-zoom regions, multi-touch areas, drag handles
   - 5.4: Mobile-Specific Patterns - Responsive control sizing, touch vs mouse layouts, thumb-reachable zones
   - 5.5: Advanced Control Types - Slider controls, radial menus, context menus, multi-state controls
   - 5.6: Proximity Analysis - Controls near edges, dynamic controls, size-changing controls

### Medium Priority:
4. **Indoor Mapping Detection** (ID: 6) - Building interiors, floor plans, mall layouts, venue maps
5. **3D Building/Terrain Visualization** (ID: 7) - Specific building models, architectural views, terrain elevation
6. **Real-time Data Overlay Maps** (ID: 8) - Traffic flow, weather patterns, live tracking, IoT sensors
7. **Geographic Heatmap Detection** (ID: 9) - Population density, COVID cases, crime statistics, environmental data
8. **Vector Tile Format Detection** (ID: 10) - MVT, PBF tiles, vector styling, dynamic rendering
9. **Language attributes touchpoint** (ID: 11)
10. **Form validation touchpoint** (ID: 12)
11. **Media alternatives touchpoint** (ID: 13) - captions, transcripts
12. **Keyboard navigation touchpoint** (ID: 14)
13. **ARIA usage validation touchpoint** (ID: 15)
14. **Link purpose detection touchpoint** (ID: 16)
15. **Page structure (landmarks) touchpoint** (ID: 17)

### Lower Priority:
- Panel UI Enhancements (Export to PDF, Batch testing, History/comparison, CI/CD)
- Performance (Virtual scrolling, Pagination, Memory optimization)
- Enhanced Reporting (Severity scoring, Time estimates, Automated fixes, Issue tracking)
- Educational Features (Interactive tutorials, Best practices gallery, WCAG technique links)

## Key Code Patterns Established:

### Critical Barrier Detection:
```javascript
const criticalBarrierPatterns = [
  'no accessible name',
  'missing accessible name',
  'keyboard trap',
  'missing form label',
  'aria-hidden="true"',
  'focus order prevents',
  'touch target.*too small',
  'insufficient touch target'
];
```

### Two-Pass Chart Rendering:
```javascript
// First pass: Draw all pie slices
// Second pass: Draw all labels with white backgrounds on top
```

### Impact Filtering Logic:
- Only applies to fail/warning issues
- Info issues pass through unaffected
- Issues without impact data are excluded when filter is active

### WebGL Map Detection Patterns:
```javascript
// Key WebGL features that indicate maps:
- Multiple texture units (>= 8)
- Framebuffer usage for layering
- Full viewport rendering
- Map-specific extensions (OES_element_index_uint, etc.)
- Alpha blending (SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
- Depth testing for 3D maps
- Scissor test for tile clipping
- Shader patterns: u_matrix, u_zoom, a_pos, tile, mercator
- High uniform count (> 10)
- Instanced rendering for markers
```

### Canvas Map Accessibility Violations:
1. `canvas-map-missing-accessibility` - Missing role and aria-label
2. `canvas-map-not-keyboard-accessible` - Missing tabindex
3. `canvas-map-no-text-alternative` - No text description
4. `webgl-map-no-3d-instructions` - 3D maps lacking navigation help

## Prompt to Restore Conversation After Compaction:

```
I'm continuing work on the Carnforth Web A11y Chrome extension.
Please read the session_state.md file in the project directory to
understand what we've been working on.

In our last session, we:
1. Enhanced canvas-based map detection with WebGL analysis
2. Added sophisticated WebGL pattern detection
3. Created 4 new accessibility violations for canvas/WebGL maps
4. Added comprehensive test fixtures for canvas and WebGL maps
5. Added TODO items for touch target analysis and additional map types

The next priority items are the sophisticated touch target analysis
patterns (items 5.1 through 5.6) or we could work on the additional
map type detection (items 6-10).

Can you review the session state and confirm you understand where we
left off?
