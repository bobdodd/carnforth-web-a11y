# Carnforth Web A11y - Session State for Continuation

## Current Date: January 25, 2025

## Work Completed in This Session:

### 1. Fixed `removeAllHighlights` Error
- Added typeof checks before calling the function to prevent errors when events fire early

### 2. Implemented Executive Summary for HTML Export
- Added executive summary section with infographics
- Fixed multiple UX issues with the summary implementation
- Implemented proper two-pass pie chart rendering with white background rectangles
- Used relative font sizes (rem) for accessibility
- Charts now match panel implementation exactly

### 3. Implemented Accessibility Metrics
- **Critical Barriers**: Count of show-stopping issues using specific patterns
- **Breadth Score**: (Touchpoints with failures / Total testable touchpoints) Ã— 100
- **A11y Index**: Combined metric (0-100, higher is better)
- Added "Accessibility Metrics Explained" chapter to HTML export
- Fixed to show ALL critical barriers in report (no truncation)

### 4. Added Impact Level Filtering
- Added impact filter group (High, Medium, Low) as checkboxes
- Impact filters only apply to fail/warning issues (info has no impact)
- Added impact level preferences in preferences modal
- Filter state properly saved/loaded

### 5. Added Impact Level Grouping
- Added "Impact" as a grouping option (alongside None, Region, Guideline, Criteria)
- Groups display in order: High Impact, Medium Impact, Low Impact, Informational
- Fixed missing function definition error

## Current TODO List:

### High Priority (Already in Code):
1. **Color Contrast Touchpoint** - Detect insufficient contrast ratios
2. **Heading Order Touchpoint** - Check heading hierarchy
3. **Advanced Map Detection** - Detect and validate accessibility of interactive maps:
   - Canvas-based maps (MapTiler, custom implementations)
   - WebGL/3D maps (Mapbox GL, Cesium, Three.js)
   - SVG-based maps (D3.js, custom vector maps)
   - Touch target analysis for map controls
   - Keyboard navigation support for map interactions
   - Screen reader announcements for map features
   - Alternative text descriptions for map content

### Medium Priority:
4. **Additional Touchpoints**:
   - Language attributes
   - Form validation
   - Media alternatives (captions, transcripts)
   - Keyboard navigation
   - ARIA usage validation
   - Link purpose detection
   - Page structure (landmarks)

### Lower Priority:
5. **Panel UI Enhancements**:
   - Export to PDF
   - Batch testing
   - History/comparison features
   - CI/CD integration

6. **Performance**:
   - Virtual scrolling
   - Pagination
   - Memory optimization

7. **Enhanced Reporting**:
   - Severity scoring
   - Time estimates
   - Automated fixes
   - Issue tracking integration

8. **Educational Features**:
   - Interactive tutorials
   - Best practices gallery
   - WCAG technique links

## Key Code Patterns Established:

### Critical Barrier Detection:
```javascript
const criticalBarrierPatterns = [
  'no accessible name',
  'missing accessible name',
  'keyboard trap',
  'missing form label',
  'aria-hidden="true"',
  'focus order prevents',
  'touch target.*too small',
  'insufficient touch target'
];
```

### Two-Pass Chart Rendering:
```javascript
// First pass: Draw all pie slices
// Second pass: Draw all labels with white backgrounds on top
```

### Impact Filtering Logic:
- Only applies to fail/warning issues
- Info issues pass through unaffected
- Issues without impact data are excluded when filter is active

## File Structure:
- Main panel logic: `/js/panel.js`
- Panel HTML: `/panel/panel.html`
- Documentation system: `/js/documentation.js`
- Test runner: `/js/test-runner.js`

## Git Status:
- Repository: https://github.com/bobdodd/carnforth-web-a11y
- All changes have been committed and pushed
- Latest commit: Fixed missing displayResultsGroupedByImpact function

## Known Issues:
- TypeScript warnings about unused 'index' parameters (non-critical)
- Some 'result' variable declared but not used warnings

## Environment:
- Working directory: /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y
- Platform: macOS Darwin 24.3.0
- Chrome DevTools Extension
