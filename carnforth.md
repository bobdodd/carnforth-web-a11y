# Carnforth Web A11y Chrome Extension

## Overview

Carnforth Web A11y is an automated web accessibility testing Chrome extension designed to help developers and accessibility professionals identify and fix accessibility issues in web applications. The extension integrates directly into Chrome DevTools and provides comprehensive testing across 23 distinct accessibility touchpoints.

## Project Context

This extension is part of the larger Carnforth accessibility testing ecosystem, which includes both command-line tools and browser-based testing capabilities. 

### The Carnforth Name

The project is named after Carnforth railway station in Lancashire, England, which was the setting for the 1945 film "Brief Encounter." The name was chosen for its layered meaning:

1. **Historical Context**: Brief Encounter was a post-war film reminding people that wartime behaviors were no longer acceptable in peacetime - similar to how web development practices must evolve to be accessible
2. **Wordplay**: "Propaganda" becomes "prop-a-gander" (assistive technology for a male goose)
3. **Philosophical**: Accessibility is fundamentally about "brief encounters" between people with disabilities and user interfaces

This naming reflects both the technical mission and the human-centered philosophy of the project.

## Architectural Design

### Extension Architecture

The extension follows Chrome's Manifest V3 specification and consists of several key components:

1. **DevTools Integration** - The extension creates a new panel within Chrome DevTools
2. **Service Worker** - Background script managing communication between components
3. **Content Scripts** - Injected scripts that analyze page content
4. **Panel UI** - Accessible interface built following WAI-ARIA best practices

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Module Architecture
- **Challenge**: Chrome extensions have limitations with ES modules in content scripts
- **Solution**: Implemented a non-module approach using script injection
- **Implementation**: Created `touchpoint-loader.js` to inject test functions into the global window scope

#### 2. Touchpoint Framework
- **Design**: Each accessibility aspect is tested through a "touchpoint" - a focused test module
- **Structure**: 23 touchpoints covering different accessibility concerns
- **Benefits**: Modular, maintainable, and allows incremental implementation

#### 3. Accessibility-First UI
- **Principle**: The testing tool itself must be fully accessible
- **Implementation**: 
  - WCAG AAA compliant color contrast (7:1 ratios)
  - Proper ARIA patterns for accordion and disclosure widgets
  - Keyboard navigation support
  - Screen reader announcements via live regions
  - Relative units (rem) for text sizing

#### 4. Result Presentation
- **Design**: Hierarchical presentation using accordion pattern
- **Organization**: 
  - Touchpoints sorted alphabetically
  - Issues within touchpoints sorted by severity (fail > warning > info)
  - Detailed information available through disclosure widgets

## Implementation Details

### Touchpoint System

Each touchpoint follows a standardized structure:

```javascript
window.test_[touchpoint_name] = async function() {
  return {
    description: "Description of what this touchpoint tests",
    issues: [
      {
        type: "fail|warning|info",
        title: "Issue title",
        description: "Detailed explanation",
        selector: "CSS selector to element",
        xpath: "XPath to element",
        html: "HTML snippet of problematic element",
        impact: {
          who: "Affected user groups",
          severity: "High|Medium|Low",
          why: "Why this matters"
        },
        wcag: {
          principle: "Perceivable|Operable|Understandable|Robust",
          guideline: "e.g., 1.1 Text Alternatives",
          successCriterion: "e.g., 1.1.1 Non-text Content",
          level: "A|AA|AAA"
        },
        remediation: [
          "Step 1 to fix",
          "Step 2 to fix"
        ],
        codeExample: {
          before: "Problematic code",
          after: "Fixed code"
        }
      }
    ]
  };
};
```

### Implemented Touchpoints

Currently, the following touchpoint has been fully implemented:

#### Maps (maps.js)
- **Purpose**: Tests digital maps for accessibility
- **Coverage**:
  - Iframe-based maps (Google Maps, Bing Maps, etc.)
  - Div-based JavaScript maps (Mapbox, Leaflet, etc.)
  - Static map images
  - SVG-based maps
- **Tests**:
  - Missing accessible names (title, aria-label, aria-labelledby)
  - Maps hidden with aria-hidden="true"
  - Interactive maps without proper ARIA attributes
  - Generic or missing alt text on static maps
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Provider detection (identifies Google Maps, Mapbox, Leaflet, etc.)
  - Interactivity detection (determines if map is interactive)
  - Comprehensive HTML snippet capture for debugging

### Technical Challenges and Solutions

#### 1. Script Context Isolation
- **Problem**: Chrome extensions have separate JavaScript contexts
- **Solution**: Script injection into page context using `document.documentElement.appendChild`
- **Implementation**: Custom event system for cross-context communication

#### 2. Element Highlighting
- **Problem**: `scrollIntoView()` was causing panel resets
- **Root Cause**: Scroll events triggered page change detection
- **Solution**: Removed auto-scrolling, added visual highlighting only

#### 3. Timing Issues
- **Problem**: Race conditions between script injection and test execution
- **Solution**: Implemented `ensureTouchpointFunctionsLoaded` with retry logic and timeouts

#### 4. Local File Testing
- **Challenge**: Chrome restrictions on file:// URLs
- **Solution**: Added file protocol permissions in manifest.json

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Fixtures
- Location: `/fixtures/`
- Purpose: Controlled environments for testing touchpoint detection
- Examples:
  - `maps_test.html` - Various map implementations
  - `accessible_name_test.html` - Interactive elements with name issues

### Python Reference Implementation
- Location: `/python_touchpoints/`
- Purpose: Original command-line implementation for reference
- Usage: Provides test logic and WCAG mapping for Chrome extension

## Comparison with Similar Tools

### vs. Axe DevTools
- **Similarities**: Chrome DevTools integration, automated testing
