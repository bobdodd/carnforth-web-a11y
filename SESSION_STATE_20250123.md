# Carnforth Web A11y Session State - January 23, 2025

## Session Summary

### Session 5 - January 23, 2025

#### Completed Work:

1. **Touch Target Size Detection** ✅
   - Added touch target size detection to maps touchpoint
   - Checks for WCAG 2.5.5 (44x44px) and 2.5.8 (24x24px) compliance
   - Reports all violations individually with full debugging details (XPath, selector, HTML)
   - Added comprehensive documentation for touch target issues
   - Created test fixtures with various touch target sizes

2. **Fixed Generic Map Names** ✅
   - Changed generic map names from warning to fail (violates WCAG 2.4.6)
   - Updated WCAG reference from 1.1.1 to 2.4.6 Headings and Labels
   - Updated severity from Medium to High

3. **Fixed XPath Display** ✅
   - Removed inline styles that were truncating XPaths
   - XPaths now display in full and wrap to multiple lines
   - Made XPaths selectable for copying to DevTools

4. **Fixed Scroll Into View** ✅
   - Replaced scrollIntoView() with window.scrollTo() to avoid navigation events
   - Added manual center calculation for better control
   - Added pulse animation to draw attention to highlighted elements
   - Fixed TypeScript warning about unused parameter

5. **Improved Highlight Styling** ✅
   - Made highlight border thicker (6px red with 2px white borders)
   - Added high contrast mode support using system colors
   - Supports both prefers-contrast and Windows High Contrast Mode
   - Enhanced pulse animation with red glow effect

6. **Fixed aria-hidden Focus Trap** ✅
   - Fixed modal closing sequence to move focus before setting aria-hidden
   - Added proper focus management when opening/closing modals
   - Stores and restores focus to the element that opened the modal

7. **Added Carnforth Project Help Button** ✅
   - Added educational help button to panel header
   - Created comprehensive documentation about the project
   - Covers project goals, automated testing limitations, 80/20 rule
   - Includes best practices and learning resources

8. **Fixed Help Button Positioning** ✅
   - Moved help buttons to immediately follow their related content
   - Removed spacers that pushed buttons to far right
   - Better accessibility for screen magnifier users
   - Reduced unnecessary panning through whitespace

### Key Technical Decisions:

- Touch target detection runs inside analyzeMapAccessibility() function
- Individual reporting for all WCAG violations (no summaries)
- window.scrollTo() instead of scrollIntoView() to avoid navigation events
- Box-shadow approach for highlight borders (better than outline)
- Help buttons use consistent blue circle design with ? symbol

### Current TODO List:

1. Add WCAG level filtering capability (A, AA, AAA) - HIGH
2. Implement search/filter functionality for issues - HIGH  
3. Implement color contrast touchpoint - HIGH
4. Implement heading order touchpoint - HIGH
5. Add severity levels to issues - MEDIUM
6. Implement issue grouping by page region - MEDIUM
7. Enhance visual highlighting system - LOW
8. Add export to issue tracking systems - LOW

### Repository State:
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Latest commit: Improved help button positioning for screen magnifier users
- Working directory clean except for screenshot files

### Remaining Touchpoints to Implement (22):
- aria_required
- color_contrast
- duplicate_id
- electronic_docs
- empty_heading
- form_label
- heading_order
- html_lang
- image_alt
- link_purpose
- list_structure
- meta_refresh
- meta_viewport
- page_title
- sensory_characteristics

### Resume Instructions:

To continue after compaction:
```
I'm resuming work on the Carnforth Web A11y Chrome extension. Please read the session state file at /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y/SESSION_STATE_20250123.md to understand what was completed and what tasks remain.

The immediate priorities are:
1. Add WCAG level filtering for issues
2. Implement search functionality for issues
3. Start on color contrast or heading order touchpoint
```

### Technical Notes:

- Maps touchpoint now includes touch target detection in analyzeMapAccessibility()
- Help buttons positioned with flexbox gap instead of margins/spacers
- Modal focus management uses dataset.lastFocus to store return focus element
- Highlight uses setTimeout(100ms) before scrolling to ensure DOM is ready
- All WCAG violations reported as 'fail' type, not 'warning'
