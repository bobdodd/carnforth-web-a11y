# Carnforth Web A11y Session State - January 22, 2025

## Session Summary

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Created TOUCHPOINT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive guide for creating new touchpoints
2. ✅ Implemented debug mode with educational logging
   - Created js/debug.js with CarnforthDebugger class
   - Created DEBUG_MODE_GUIDE.md documentation
   - Updated manifest.json to include debug.js
3. ✅ Reviewed and expanded map provider coverage
   - Added 15+ new providers (Baidu, Amap, Naver, Kakao, etc.)
   - Updated all detection functions in maps.js
   - Created MAP_PROVIDER_ANALYSIS.md
4. ✅ Created comprehensive test fixture (maps_comprehensive_test.html)
5. ✅ Analyzed fixture coverage (FIXTURE_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md)

### Pending Tasks (TODO List)
1. **Combine all maps fixtures into a single maps_test.html file**
   - Merge: maps_test.html, maps_extended_test.html, maps_svg_test.html, maps_div_enhanced_test.html, maps_comprehensive_test.html
   - Follow simplicity principle

2. **Add Info issue to maps.js listing map providers found on page**
   - Only show when maps are found (no "No maps found" messages)
   - List providers as informational issue

3. **Create info mechanism for touchpoints to explain what they test**
   - Add touchpoint description
   - Full list of tests covered
   - Link to documentation

4. **Add best practice recommendations for avoiding issues**
   - Include in violation reports
   - Provide prevention tips
   - Link to examples

5. **Create mechanism to provide access to documentation**
   - Debug mode guide
   - Touchpoint development guide
   - WCAG references
   - Best practices

### Recent Git Commits
- Commit 52497e6: "Add debug mode, expand map providers, and create comprehensive documentation"
- Previous commit 4991630: Added three enhancements to maps.js (interactive element detection, landmark/heading detection, meaningful name validation)

### Current State
- Working directory: /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth
- Repository: CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y
- All changes committed to GitHub

### Key Implementation Notes

#### Debug Mode
- Enable via: `window.CARNFORTH_DEBUG = true` or `localStorage.setItem('carnforth_debug', 'true')`
- Provides educational logging with WCAG context
- Performance timing for optimization
- Exports debug logs as JSON

#### Map Providers Added
- **Asian**: Baidu Maps, Amap, Naver Maps, Kakao Maps
- **Regional**: 2GIS, Mapy.cz, Maptiler, ViaMichelin, Ordnance Survey
- **Static Maps**: Added detection for static map APIs from new providers

#### Recommendations for Next Session
1. Start with combining map fixtures (simplicity principle)
2. Implement info issue for detected providers
3. Design UI mechanism for documentation access (possibly help menu)
4. Consider adding provider-specific best practices

### Files Modified/Created This Session
- js/touchpoints/maps.js (expanded providers)
- js/debug.js (new)
- js/touchpoints/maps-debug-example.js (new)
