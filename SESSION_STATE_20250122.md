```
I'm resuming work on the Carnforth Web A11y Chrome extension. Please read the session state file at /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y/SESSION_STATE_20250122.md to understand what was completed and what tasks remain.

The main pending task is #20: "Add info button to individual issues with educational details about specific violations" which would extend the documentation system to provide context-specific help at the individual issue level.
