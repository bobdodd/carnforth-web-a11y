### In Progress - Documentation Access Mechanism
**Task #12: Create info mechanism for touchpoints to explain what they test in detail**

**Design Decision**: Create a reusable documentation system with:
- Help buttons (?) next to each touchpoint in the accordion headers
- Modal dialog that opens with comprehensive documentation
- Accessible implementation with proper ARIA, keyboard navigation, and focus management

**Implementation Started**:
1. Created js/documentation.js with:
   - Touchpoint documentation content structure
   - Modal creation and management functions
   - Accessible modal with focus trapping
   - Help button creation function
   - Example documentation for maps and accessible_name touchpoints

2. Started adding CSS styles to panel.css for:
   - Help button styling (circular blue button with ?)
   - Modal dialog styling
   - Responsive design
   - Proper contrast and accessibility

**User Decision**: User approves this modal-based documentation design approach

### Pending Tasks (TODO List)
1. **Complete documentation access mechanism** (Task #12 - IN PROGRESS)
   - Finish CSS implementation
   - Integrate help buttons into panel.js accordion headers
   - Add documentation content for all touchpoints
   
2. **Include full list of tests covered by each touchpoint** (Task #13)
   - Already partially implemented in documentation.js structure
   
3. **Add best practice recommendations for avoiding issues** (Task #14)
   - Already partially implemented in documentation.js structure
   
4. **Create mechanism to provide access to documentation** (Task #15)
   - Being addressed by current modal implementation

### Recent Git Commits

### Current State
- Working directory: /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y
- All changes committed to GitHub
- Documentation mechanism design approved but not yet committed

### Key Design Decisions This Session

#### Documentation Access Mechanism
- **Approach**: Modal dialog with help buttons in UI
- **Rationale**: 
  - Non-intrusive to test results
  - Reusable across all touchpoints
  - Accessible implementation possible
  - Educational without cluttering issues
- **Components**:
  - js/documentation.js - Core documentation system
  - Help buttons in accordion headers
  - Modal dialog for detailed content
  - Structured documentation for each touchpoint

### Next Steps for New Session
1. Complete the documentation access mechanism implementation:
   - Finish adding CSS styles to panel.css
   - Modify panel.js to add help buttons to accordion headers
   - Test the modal functionality
   - Add documentation content for remaining touchpoints
2. Commit and push the documentation system
3. Consider adding a global help/documentation button
4. Plan for documenting the debug mode and other features

### Technical Notes
- Issue deduplication is working correctly in maps.js using elementTracker
- Debug mode can be enabled via localStorage.setItem('carnforth_debug', 'true')
- All map providers are now detected and reported
