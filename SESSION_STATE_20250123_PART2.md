### Resume Instructions:

To continue after compaction:
```
I'm resuming work on the Carnforth Web A11y Chrome extension. Please read the session state file at /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y/SESSION_STATE_20250123_PART2.md to understand what was completed and what tasks remain.

We just completed enhancing the HTML export functionality with:
- Chapter 4 "About Touchpoints" containing full documentation
- Hierarchical numbering throughout the report
- Comprehensive HTML escaping
- Fixed various export bugs

The immediate priorities from our TODO list are:
1. Add WCAG level filtering for issues
2. Implement search functionality for issues  
3. Start on color contrast or heading order touchpoint

All changes have been committed and pushed to GitHub. The working directory is clean.
```

### Technical Notes:

- HTML exports now include full touchpoint documentation in Chapter 4
- escapeHtml() function prevents XSS and rendering issues
- implementedTouchpoints array controls which touchpoints appear in Chapter 4
- Hierarchical numbering uses <span class="section-number"> for styling
- Code examples use .code-example class with gray background
- All user content is escaped: titles, descriptions, impact statements, etc.

### Export Features Status:
- ✅ JSON export - includes all issue data
- ✅ CSV export - includes key fields (no code examples due to format)
- ✅ HTML export - comprehensive with documentation, examples, and proper escaping
