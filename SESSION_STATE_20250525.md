| 21 | Add automatic highlight removal on focus loss/DevTools close | ✅ completed | high |

## Completed Work in This Session:

### 1. Fixed Issue Expansion in Grouped Views ✅
- **Problem**: Issues wouldn't expand when grouped by WCAG guideline or success criteria
- **Solution**: Added missing `initializeIssueDisclosures()` calls to grouping functions
- **Files**: `js/panel.js`

### 2. Simplified Element Highlighting ✅
- **Problem**: Multiple elements were highlighted, sometimes wrong elements
- **Solution**: Clear all existing highlights before adding new ones
- **Implementation**: 
  - Modified both `highlight.js` and `content.js`
  - Ensures only one element is highlighted at a time
  - Maintains scroll-to-view functionality

### 3. Fixed Map Element Highlighting ✅
Multiple fixes were required:

#### a) Full XPath Selectors
- **Problem**: ID-based selectors were causing wrong elements to be selected
- **Solution**: Always use full XPath from `/html` root
- **Implementation**: Updated `getFullXPath()` to build complete paths

#### b) XPath Position Counting
- **Problem**: Position counting was backwards (counting previous siblings)
- **Solution**: Count position correctly from beginning using `indexOf()`

#### c) XPath String Escaping
- **Problem**: XPath selectors with brackets weren't properly escaped
- **Solution**: Use `JSON.stringify()` for proper escaping

#### d) XPath Evaluation Order
- **Problem**: Code tried CSS selector first, then XPath
- **Solution**: Check for XPath patterns first, evaluate immediately

#### e) Selector Consistency
- **Problem**: Code was converting XPath to CSS nth-of-type selectors
- **Solution**: Always use XPath for the selector field in issues

### 4. Automatic Highlight Removal ✅
- **Implementation**: Added `removeAllHighlights()` function
- **Triggers**:
  - DevTools panel loses focus (blur event)
  - DevTools panel closes (beforeunload event)
  - DevTools panel is hidden (visibilitychange event)
  - New test is started
- **Files**: `js/panel.js`

### 5. Phase 2 Map Detection Improvements ✅
- **Custom Map Patterns**: Detects tile structures, coordinate positioning, data attributes
- **ARIA Landmarks**: Detects `role="region"` and `role="application"` with map labels
- **Test Coverage**: Added 8 new test cases in `fixtures/maps_test.html`
- **Files**: `js/touchpoints/maps.js`, `fixtures/maps_test.html`

## Technical Decisions Made:

1. **Highlighting Philosophy**: One element at a time, cleared automatically
2. **Selector Strategy**: Always use full XPath for accuracy and consistency
3. **XPath Format**: `/html/body[1]/main[1]/section[1]/div[1]/div[4]/iframe[1]`
4. **Event Handling**: Use multiple events to ensure cleanup in all scenarios

## File Changes Summary:

### Modified Files:
1. `js/panel.js` - Added issue disclosure init, automatic highlight removal
2. `js/highlight.js` - Simplified highlighting, fixed XPath evaluation
3. `js/content.js` - Matching highlight simplification
4. `js/touchpoints/maps.js` - Fixed XPath generation, added Phase 2 features
5. `fixtures/maps_test.html` - Added Phase 2 test cases

## Environment State:
- Working directory: `/Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y`
- Latest commit: 21e4dd9 "Add automatic highlight removal when DevTools loses focus or closes"
- Git status: Clean (all changes committed and pushed)
- Branch: main

## Remaining High Priority Work:
1. **Implement color contrast touchpoint** - Essential WCAG requirement
2. **Implement heading order touchpoint** - Critical for navigation

## Known Issues Resolved:
- ✅ Issue expansion in grouped views
- ✅ Multiple/wrong elements being highlighted
- ✅ Map elements highlighting incorrectly
- ✅ Lingering highlights after DevTools loses focus

## Design Recommendations Not Yet Implemented:
1. Enhanced Keyboard Navigation (shortcuts, skip links)
2. Advanced Filtering & Search (severity, element type, complexity)
3. Export & Reporting Features (CSV/JSON/PDF)
4. Visual Enhancements (data viz, heatmaps, progress tracking)
5. Collaboration Features (annotations, sharing, tracking)
6. Performance Optimizations (virtual scrolling, lazy loading)
7. Enhanced User Guidance (tutorials, help links)
8. Accessibility Improvements to the tool itself
9. Smart Features (ML, pattern recognition)
10. Developer Tools Integration (code snippets, DevTools integration)
