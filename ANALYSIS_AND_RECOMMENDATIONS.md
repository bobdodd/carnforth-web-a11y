# Carnforth Web A11y - Analysis and Recommendations

## Date: January 22, 2025

## Project Understanding

### Core Purpose
Carnforth Web A11y is designed as an **educational browser extension** for single-page accessibility testing. Key aspects:

1. **Teaching Tool**: Primary goal is to demonstrate how to build accessibility testing tools
2. **GPL Licensed**: Free and open source to encourage learning and adaptation
3. **Single Page Focus**: Tests only the current page (not a site crawler)
4. **Part of Larger Ecosystem**: Browser extension complements broader Carnforth testing suite
5. **Simplicity Over Performance**: Deliberately avoids complexity to maintain clarity

### Project Philosophy
- Named after Carnforth railway station (Brief Encounter film location)
- Wordplay: "prop-a-gander" (assistive technology for a male goose)
- Metaphor: Accessibility as "brief encounters" between users and interfaces
- Educational mission: Show both technical implementation and human impact

## Current State Analysis

## Notes for Future Reference

- This is an educational tool first, testing tool second
- Simplicity and clarity trump performance and features
- Every line of code should teach something
- Documentation is as important as implementation
- The tool should demonstrate best practices in accessibility

## Maps Testing Requirements (Added Jan 22, 2025)

### Key Distinctions
1. **Interactive vs Non-Interactive Maps**
   - Interactive: Contains focusable elements (buttons, links, tabindex)
   - Non-interactive: Static presentation only

2. **Critical Violations for Interactive Maps**
   - aria-hidden="true" → FAIL WCAG 1.3.1 (Info & Relationships)
   - role="presentation" → FAIL WCAG 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value)
   - Both create "silent focus traps" for keyboard users

3. **Naming Requirements**
   - Iframe maps: Need title, aria-label, or aria-labelledby
   - SVG maps: Need <title>, aria-label, or aria-labelledby + proper role
   - Div-based maps: Need landmark OR heading (fail if neither, warn if only heading)

4. **Implementation Tasks**
   - Enhance interactivity detection (scan for focusable elements) - PENDING
   - Fix WCAG mappings (current mappings incorrect) - COMPLETED Jan 22
   - Add landmark/heading detection for div maps - PENDING
   - Validate meaningful names (not just "map") - PENDING

## Session Summary - January 22, 2025 (Part 1)

### Completed Work - Morning Session
1. **Enhanced maps.js with educational comments**
   - Added comprehensive inline documentation
   - Explained Chrome extension constraints and workarounds
   - Documented detection strategies and patterns

2. **Created TOUCHPOINT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md**
   - Step-by-step instructions for new touchpoints
   - Detection strategies with examples
   - WCAG mapping guidelines
   - Common patterns library

3. **Fixed WCAG Mappings in maps.js**
   - Added role="presentation" detection for interactive maps
   - Correctly mapped violations to WCAG criteria:
     - Interactive + aria-hidden → 1.3.1 Info & Relationships
     - Interactive + role="presentation" → 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value
     - Non-interactive + aria-hidden → 1.1.1 Non-text Content (AT RISK)
   - Added proper remediation guidance for each violation type

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Created MAPS_TESTING_REQUIREMENTS.md with correct testing approach
   - Updated carnforth.md with Brief Encounter backstory
   - Created this ANALYSIS_AND_RECOMMENDATIONS.md for continuity

5. **Committed to GitHub**
   - All changes pushed to carnforth-web-a11y repository
   - Commit hash: 636ad93

### Key Project Insights
- This is an educational tool first, testing tool second
- Chrome extension runs in isolated context (requires script injection)
- Maps touchpoint serves as reference implementation
- Project name references Brief Encounter film (accessibility as "brief encounters")

## Questions to Revisit

1. Should we add video tutorials for complex concepts?
2. Would interactive exercises help learning?
3. Should we create a companion website with extended tutorials?
4. How can we best document the evolution of the codebase?
