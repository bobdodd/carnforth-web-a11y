# Carnforth Web A11y Session State - January 23, 2025 (Part 5)

## Session Summary

### Completed Work in This Session:

1. **Added Results Summary Console** ✅
   - Created ACCESSIBILITY_SCORING.md documenting scoring methodology
   - Added wcag-mapping.js with complete WCAG 2.2 success criteria mapping
   - Implemented visual charts (pie charts for impact/type, bar chart for WCAG levels)
   - Added score info button with methodology explanation
   - Console appears automatically after test results
   - Scores update when WCAG filters change

2. **Fixed WCAG Level Chart** ✅
   - Corrected to use issue.wcag.level instead of touchpoint mapping
   - Now properly shows AA and AAA violations
   - Fixed TypeScript warnings (unused parameters)

3. **Redesigned Scoring System** ✅
   - After discussion about scoring philosophy, completely revised the approach
   - Moved from success criteria-based scoring to three distinct metrics:
     - **Critical Barriers**: Direct count of show-stoppers (only 0 is acceptable)
     - **Breadth Score**: % of relevant touchpoints with failures
     - **A11y Index**: Combined directional metric
   - Updated ACCESSIBILITY_SCORING.md with new methodology
   - Removed disability-based weighting in favor of WCAG principle weighting

### Current TODO List:
| ID | Task | Status | Priority |
|----|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Implement color contrast touchpoint - WCAG 1.4.3 (AA) and 1.4.6 (AAA) | pending | high |
| 2 | Implement heading order touchpoint - Check for skipped heading levels and proper nesting | pending | high |
| 3 | Review and strengthen map identification especially for SVG maps - badly implemented SVG images seem to be identified as maps | pending | high |
| 4 | Add results summary console with charts and accessibility scores | ✅ completed | high |
| 5 | Update the console to use the new three-metric scoring mechanism (Critical Barriers, Breadth Score, A11y Index) | pending | high |
| 6 | Make the charts accessible - add text alternatives, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation | pending | high |

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Scoring Philosophy**:
   - Conformance is binary - these are directional indicators only
   - Critical barriers must be zero for accessibility
   - Breadth shows how many different areas are affected
   - A11y Index provides overall direction for improvement tracking

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Charts use HTML5 canvas
   - WCAG mapping loaded as regular script (not ES6 module)
   - Scoring excludes touchpoints with no testable elements
   - Principle weighting: Perceivable/Operable (1.0), Understandable (0.8), Robust (0.7)

### Important Context from Discussion:

The user provided valuable perspective on accessibility scoring:
- "You can no more be 80% conformant than you can be 80% alive"
- Industry demands metrics despite their limitations
- Three types of metrics needed:
  1. Breadth of inaccessibility (how many touchpoints fail)
  2. Show-stopper count (critical barriers)
  3. Usability friction (total issues regardless of impact)
- WCAG represents distilled lived experience, not just checklists
- Weighting by disability would be problematic; principle weighting is preferred

### Repository State:
- All changes committed
- Latest commit: "Fix WCAG level chart and TypeScript warnings"
- Working directory clean except for session state files
- 5 commits from this session

### Environment:
- Working directory: /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y
- Platform: macOS
- Chrome extension development environment
- Claude Code update available (restart needed)

## Resume Instructions for Next Session:

To resume work after restart, use this prompt:

```
I'm resuming work on the Carnforth Web A11y Chrome extension. Please read the session state file at /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y/SESSION_STATE_20250123_PART5.md to understand what was completed and what tasks remain.

In the previous session we:
1. Added a results summary console with charts and accessibility scores
2. Fixed the WCAG level chart to properly count AA and AAA violations
3. Had an important discussion about scoring philosophy and completely redesigned the scoring system
4. Updated ACCESSIBILITY_SCORING.md with a new three-metric approach: Critical Barriers, Breadth Score, and A11y Index

The immediate next tasks are:
1. Update the console implementation to use the new three-metric scoring system
2. Make the charts accessible with text alternatives and ARIA labels

All changes have been committed. The working directory is clean.
