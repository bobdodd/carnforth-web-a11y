# Carnforth Web A11y Session State - January 24, 2025

## Session Summary

### Completed Work in This Session:

1. **Updated Console to New Three-Metric Scoring System** ✅
   - Replaced raw/weighted scores with Critical Barriers, Breadth Score, and A11y Index
   - Updated HTML to display new metrics with appropriate styling
   - Added CSS for metric cards with visual indicators
   - Updated info button to explain new methodology
   - Implemented getPrincipleFromCriterion helper function
   - Calculate metrics based on touchpoint failures and critical barrier patterns

2. **Made Charts Accessible with SVG** ✅
   - Replaced canvas-based charts with accessible SVG implementations
   - Added minimum 16px font size (1rem) for all chart text
   - Used relative units (rem) throughout
   - Added ARIA labels and roles for each chart element
   - Made chart slices and bars keyboard navigable with tabindex
   - Created screen reader-only data tables as alternatives
   - Implemented SVG patterns for differentiation without color reliance
   - Added proper focus indicators for interactive elements
   - Ensured Windows High Contrast Mode support

3. **Fixed Chart Display Issues** ✅
   - Added white background rectangles behind pie chart values for contrast
   - Moved legends below charts with vertical layout to prevent overlap
   - Applied patterns by default to all chart elements
   - Fixed text cropping by moving labels closer to center (0.6 radius)
   - Removed duplicate color indicators in legend
   - Increased label background size (24px height)
   - Dynamic legend height calculation
   - Increased legend text size to 14px

### Current TODO List:
| ID | Task | Status | Priority |
|----|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Update the console implementation to use the new three-metric scoring system | ✅ completed | high |
| 2 | Make the charts accessible - add text alternatives, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation | ✅ completed | high |
| 3 | Implement color contrast touchpoint - WCAG 1.4.3 (AA) and 1.4.6 (AAA) | pending | high |
| 4 | Implement heading order touchpoint - Check for skipped heading levels and proper nesting | pending | high |
| 5 | Review and strengthen map identification especially for SVG maps - badly implemented SVG images seem to be identified as maps | pending | high |

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Three-Metric Scoring System**:
   - Critical Barriers: Must be zero for accessibility
   - Breadth Score: Percentage of touchpoints with failures
   - A11y Index: Combined directional metric (0-100)
   - Metrics stored in window.scoringDetails for info button

2. **Accessible SVG Charts**:
   - All charts use patterns (stripes/dots/lines) by default
   - White backgrounds with dark text for contrast
   - Vertical legends below charts to prevent overlap
   - Hidden data tables for screen reader users
   - Pattern fills visible in all modes (not just high contrast)

### Important Context:

1. **Scoring Philosophy** (from previous session):
   - "You can no more be 80% conformant than you can be 80% alive"
   - Metrics are directional indicators, not compliance measures
   - WCAG represents distilled lived experience

2. **Chart Accessibility Requirements**:
   - Minimum 16px text size (browser default)
   - Relative units only (rem)
   - No color-only information
   - Support for Windows High Contrast Mode

### Repository State:
- All changes committed
- Latest commit: "Fix remaining chart display issues"
- Working directory clean
- 3 commits from this session

### File Changes Made:
1. `js/panel.js` - Updated scoring calculations and chart implementations
2. `panel/panel.html` - Updated to show new metrics and use divs for charts
3. `css/panel.css` - Added styles for metrics and accessible SVG charts
4. `ACCESSIBILITY_SCORING.md` - Already updated with new methodology (from previous session)

### Environment:
- Working directory: /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y
- Platform: macOS
- Chrome extension development environment

## Resume Instructions After Compaction:

To resume work after compaction, use this prompt:

```
I'm resuming work on the Carnforth Web A11y Chrome extension. Please read the session state file at /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y/SESSION_STATE_20250124.md to understand what was completed and what tasks remain.

In the previous session we:
1. Updated the console to use the new three-metric scoring system (Critical Barriers, Breadth Score, A11y Index)
2. Implemented accessible SVG charts with patterns, proper text sizing, and high contrast support
3. Fixed chart display issues including text cropping, duplicate legend indicators, and insufficient label backgrounds

The next pending tasks are:
1. Implement color contrast touchpoint - WCAG 1.4.3 (AA) and 1.4.6 (AAA)
2. Implement heading order touchpoint - Check for skipped heading levels and proper nesting
3. Review and strengthen map identification especially for SVG maps

All changes have been committed. The working directory is clean.
