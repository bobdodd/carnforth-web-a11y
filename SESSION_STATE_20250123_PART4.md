# Carnforth Web A11y Session State - January 23, 2025 (Part 4)

## Session Summary

### Completed Work in This Session:

1. **Fixed Impact Score Display** ✅
   - Issue: Impact scores weren't displaying in the panel
   - Root cause: Panel.js was looking for `impact.severity` but touchpoints were setting `impact.level`
   - Fixed by updating panel.js to use `impact.level` instead
   - Added visual styling for impact levels with color-coded badges:
     - High impact: Red background (#fee) with dark red text (#b71c1c)
     - Medium impact: Orange background (#fff3e0) with dark orange text (#e65100)
     - Low impact: Green background (#e8f5e9) with dark green text (#1b5e20)
   - Impact level text is now capitalized (e.g., "high" → "High")

2. **Implemented Issue Grouping by Page Region** ✅
   - Created `getPageRegion()` utility function in maps.js that:
     - Detects which landmark/region an element belongs to
     - Checks for explicit ARIA landmarks (banner, navigation, main, etc.)
     - Checks for implicit HTML5 landmarks (header, nav, main, aside, footer)
     - Returns region name, landmark role, and landmark label
   - Updated all map touchpoint violations to include:
     - `region`: Human-readable region name (e.g., "Header", "Main Content", "Navigation: Primary")
     - `landmark`: Technical landmark role (e.g., "banner", "main", "navigation")
   - Added UI features:
     - "Group by page region" checkbox in filter section
     - Region information displays in issue details
     - Created `displayResultsGroupedByRegion()` function
   - Regions are sorted logically: Header → Navigation → Main → Footer → Others
   - Within regions, issues are sub-grouped by touchpoint

3. **Added Preference for Group by Region Default** ✅
   - Added checkbox in Preferences modal: "Group issues by page region by default"
   - Added `groupByRegionDefault: false` to preferences object
   - Preference is persisted using chrome.storage.local
   - When test results display, the checkbox state and view are set based on preference
   - Users can still toggle the view temporarily with the checkbox

### Current TODO List:
| ID | Task | Status | Priority |
|----|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Implement color contrast touchpoint - WCAG 1.4.3 (AA) and 1.4.6 (AAA) | pending | high |
| 2 | Implement heading order touchpoint - Check for skipped heading levels and proper nesting | pending | high |
| 3 | Update existing touchpoints to include WCAG version information | ✅ completed | medium |
| 4 | Fix impact score not displaying in panel | ✅ completed | high |
| 5 | Implement issue grouping by page region | ✅ completed | medium |

### Technical Implementation Details:

1. **Impact Score Display Fix**
   - Changed `issue.impact.severity` to `issue.impact.level` in panel.js
   - Added CSS classes for visual distinction of impact levels
   - Each impact level has distinct colors meeting WCAG contrast requirements

2. **Region Detection Implementation**
   - Region detection runs in page context via injected function
   - Supports both ARIA landmarks and HTML5 semantic elements
   - Handles edge cases (header/footer only landmarks at top level)
   - Provides fallback "Unknown Region" for elements outside landmarks

3. **Grouping Display Architecture**
   - Alternative display mode that reorganizes all issues by page region
   - Maintains all existing functionality (filtering, search, export)
   - CSS styling differentiates region accordions from touchpoint accordions
   - Touchpoint subsections within regions maintain visual hierarchy

### Key Technical Decisions:

- Impact levels use `level` property (not `severity`) to match IMPACT_SCORING.md
- Region detection prioritizes explicit ARIA landmarks over implicit HTML5 landmarks
- Group by region is opt-in (checkbox) with preference for default state
- Region names are human-friendly while maintaining technical accuracy

### Repository State:
- All changes committed and ready for push
- Latest commit: "Add preference setting for group by region default"
- Working directory clean
- 3 commits from this session

### Environment:
- Working directory: /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y
- Platform: macOS
- Chrome extension development environment

## Resume Instructions for Next Session:

To resume work after compaction, use this prompt:

```
I'm resuming work on the Carnforth Web A11y Chrome extension. Please read the session state file at /Users/bob3/Documents/Bob/demos/puppeteer/Carnforth/CarnforthGPL/chrome_carnforth_plugin/carnforth-web-a11y/SESSION_STATE_20250123_PART4.md to understand what was completed and what tasks remain.

In this session we:
1. Fixed the impact score display issue - panel.js now correctly reads impact.level
2. Implemented issue grouping by page region with region detection
3. Added a preference setting for the group by region default value

The remaining high-priority tasks from our TODO list are:
1. Implement color contrast touchpoint - WCAG 1.4.3 (AA) and 1.4.6 (AAA)
2. Implement heading order touchpoint - Check for skipped heading levels and proper nesting

All changes have been committed. The working directory is clean.
